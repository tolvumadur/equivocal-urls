# equivocal-urls
Code for comparing 15 different URL parsers, looking for URLs which equivocate on their hostname depending on the parser used to read them.

I wrote this code for the paper "[Equivocal URLs: Understanding the Fragmented Space of URL Parser Implementations](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-17143-7_9)" which won a Best Paper award at ESORICS 2022.

My co-authors were Adam Bates from UIUC and Michael Bailey from GA Tech.
